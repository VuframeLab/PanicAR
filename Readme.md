## Why PanicAR?

* It’s fast, simple and affordable
* No monthly or annual fees
* It’s completely customizable
* It’s small (only ~3 mb)
* It's platform agnostic - powered by Cocoa and Cocoa only
* It’s ridiculously easy to integrate

## Why PanicAR – really?

* does the same things all the other frameworks do: even some more (i.e. "altitude")
* maintained for you by us: new devices and new OS releases will be supported
* pay on a per-app basis: a white-label license is really cheap (see here: www.dopanic.com/ar)
